    <br>you do in your software communities :sparkles:<br><br>

  I want to make a little game this year. that makes it really easy to design a game if you're primarily focusing on the art and story (like myself). I'm hoping to print this on a cartridge when I'm done so you can actually experience it on a Gameboy!
